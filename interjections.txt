INTERJECTION 1:
*Halfling body South of Beregost*
Galileo: Well that's only slightly disturbing. <END DIALOGUE>

INTERJECTION 2:
*Encounter Alora*
Galileo: Oh, to be lovestruck at first sight! Come now, <CHARNAME>, please accept this beautiful young lady into our midst so that we may be blessed with her presence.
1. Uhh, right. I'll just talk to her, then.
2. No.
	Galileo: Ah, you wound me with your rejection of such a marvelous proposal! With such a simple word as 'no' you blot out the bright summer sun emerging in my heart, to replace it with a dark graveyard filled with endless despair and --
	1. Do you ever shut up?!
		Galileo: *Sigh* Okay, boss. Lead on. <END DIALOGUE>
	2. Beautiful. Now let's go.
		Galileo: If I didn't know any better, I would say that was sarcasm. Did anyone else think that was sarcasm? I think it was sarcasm. <END DIALOGUE>
	3. *Remain silent*
		Galileo: And -- *Chokes* -- Alas, my prose is stopped by such an insignificant thing as a lump in my throat? The lump that is surely forming due to my sudden undying love for this beautiful lass that stands before us? Oh, the indignity! <CHARNAME>, say it is not so!
		1. How could I possibly live with the guilt of wounding the tender heart of this hopelessly lovestruck halfling? Okay Galileo, I will allow this girl to join us.
			Galileo: Victory! <END DIALOGUE>
		2. No means no, Galileo. I am sorry.
			Galileo: Ahh, I understand. We are already knee-deep in our 	quest, and indeed, the very excrement of our enemies. <END DIALOGUE>
		3. Beautiful. Now let's go.
			Galileo: If I didn't know any better, I would say that was sarcasm. Did anyone else think that was sarcasm? I think it was sarcasm. <END DIALOGUE>

INTERJECTION 3:
*Short timer after acquiring Melicamp the Chicken*
Galileo: Hey <CHARNAME>, I hear Feldepost fetches a fair price for fresh poultry... Only joking.

INTERJECTION 4:
*Upon being resurrected for the first time*
Galileo: Ahh!
1. You're welcome.
	Galileo: Yes, yes, thank you. That was ... frightening. <END DIALOGUE>
2. Try not to get into trouble again.
	Galileo: Heh, I'll try my best. <END DIALOGUE>
3. Not sure why I bothered.
	Galileo: Gee, thanks. <END DIALOGUE>
4. I may have had to sell your hat to fund this.
	Galileo: What?! No! No!!
	1. Relax, it's right here.
		Galileo: You nearly gave me a heart attack... <END DIALOGUE>
	2. Yeah. Sorry.
		Galileo: This is NOT okay! We have to buy it back, or find another hat, quickly!
		1. Ever considered not wearing a hat? You look good to me.
			Galileo: I -- ah, thank you.
		2. If you insist.
			Galileo: Let us be off!
			1. Err, shouldn't we be healing you first?
				Galileo: Healing is for the weak! Let's go! Oww. Okay, maybe a spell or two would be welcome...
			<OR END DIALOGUE>
		3. Galileo, we have more important things to do than go hat shopping.
			Galileo: Ooh, fine.

INTERJECTION 5:
*Re-recruiting*
Galileo: Fancy seeing you here. Starting to miss my company, I hope? I know I've missed yours', my friend.
1. Yes, Galileo, I would like to take you back in.
	Galileo: Excellent! Let's be on our way! <END DIALOGUE> <GALILEO JOINS>
2. I just thought I'd say hello and check on how you're doing. I do not need your services at the moment.
	Galileo: Yes, you don't need them, but do you want them?
	1. Quite amusing, Galileo. Why not, welcome aboard.
		Galileo: Excellent! Let's be on our way! <END DIALOGUE><GALILEO JOINS>
	2. Very funny, but no, I must be off.
		Galileo: I suppose it will take more than a witty line or two to win myself back into your group. Fair enough. Thanks for stopping by, and best of luck on your travels. <END DIALOGUE>
3. No, I must be on my way.
	Galileo: What a tease! I'll win myself back into your party yet, just you wait. <END DIALOGUE>

INTERJECTION 6:
*Booting from party, without GALIFRIENDS=1 active*
Galileo: Bloody hell! Was it something I said?
1. Hah! No, but I must be going on without you.
	Galileo: But... Why?
	1. I've grown rather sick of your constant banter. Goodbye and good riddance.
		Galileo: Well, I never! <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>
	2. You're not a good fit for this party, Galileo. Best of luck in your journeys.
		Galileo: Oh, very well... Wyvernspur watch over you, <CHARNAME>. <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>
	3.  Ahh, nevermind, my mistake.
		Galileo: Just like that? Well... Alright. <END DIALOGUE><GALILEO JOINS>
2. Honestly, yes. I've grown rather sick of your constant banter. Goodbye and good riddance.
	Galileo: Well, I never! <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>

4. Ahh, nevermind, my mistake.
	Galileo: Just like that? Well... Alright. <END DIALOGUE><GALILEO JOINS>

INTERJECTION 7:
*Booting from party, with GALIFRIENDS=1 active*
Galileo: You're... You're letting me go? Was it something I did? Was I not useful enough?
1. No, you've done well. Unfortunately, the dangerous path ahead requires that I reevaluate the composition of the party, and I have made this choice.
	Galileo: I don't care about the danger. Well, it frightens me a little, but I can work past it! I told you I'd stick by your side, <CHARNAME>! Are you absolutely sure?
	1. Oh, fine. You sure know how to make this sort of thing hard, my friend. <END DIALOGUE><GALILEO JOINS>
	2. We've had a good run. After my fight is over, I will be sure to visit you.
		Galileo: That would be good. Oh, I'm tearing up a little, but I'll get over it. Wyvernspur watch over you, and farewell, <CHARNAME>. <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>
	3. Yes, the decision is final.
		Galileo: Tragic. Best of luck, and please... Come visit me some time. <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>
2. It's nothing personal, but I need stronger allies to overcome these more and more dangerous enemies.
	Galileo: I don't care about the danger. Well, it frightens me a little, but I can be stronger if you need me to be! I told you I'd stick by your side, <CHARNAME>! Are you absolutely sure?
	1. Oh, fine. You sure know how to make this sort of thing hard, my friend. <END DIALOGUE><GALILEO JOINS>
	2. We've had a good run. After my fight is over, I will be sure to visit you.

	3. Yes, the decision is final.
		Galileo: Tragic. Best of luck, and please... Come visit me some time. <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>
3. I don't owe you any explanation. You have been useful, but this is my party, and this is my decision. Goodbye, Galileo.
	Galileo: Well, I never! <END DIALOGUE><BOOT GALILEO>

INTERJECTION 8:
*Being attacked or robbed while not in party*
Galileo: Oi! What the bloody hell is your problem?
*Turn hostile*
('Tis an overhead in-game message, matey!!)

INTERJECTION 9:
*Right after Alora joins the party, if in the Hall of Wonders*
Galileo: Hello there, my lady! Welcome aboard.
Alora: Um... Hi! What's your name?
Galileo: I am called Galileo; bard, servant of Finder Wyvernspur, and I am at your service, miss.
1. I don't know whether to be more annoyed that you introduce yourself exactly the same way whenever you meet someone, or the fact that you want to chit-chat when we're in the middle of a grand heist. Cut the chatter.
	Alora: Oops! We need to be more sneaky, Galileo!
	Galileo: Oh, ahh, right.
2. Shush, save the chit-chat for later.
	Alora: Oops! I just remembered, we need to be more sneaky, Galileo!
	Galileo: Oh, ahh, right.

<WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET>
INTERJECTION 10:
*When Dorn accuses party members of being untrustworthy*
Galileo: Honestly, Dorn, I don't give a damn what you think. You're a blackguard! Your first priority is your patron, not <CHARNAME>. Who are you to 
Dorn: He uses verbose speech to cover up his lack of conviction.

INTERJECTION 11:
*When Zhurlong pick pockets you/gives you his quest*
Galileo: Hey, did he just take your wallet! He just took <CHARNAME>'s wallet! I think he took your wallet... <END DIALOGUE>
