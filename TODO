===(CrevsDaak):
-strip clean .tp2 of its own TODOs
-clean this directory of dev files
-check if icons are done, do if not done
-check for mods that alter memo tables, apply changes as needed
-check for mods that alter spells we're using, apply changes as needed
-install tutu and eet for testing, get a second bgt install as well
-enforce game-specific checks in a more strict manner
-checkout how charsets stuff works if done. I hope what's there works honestly.
-check dialogs, banters for possible bugs
-apparently we're adding a .pro? check this out.
-compression of .wav files? 10 megs is nothing today. check this out anyway
-update galileo.txt accordingly
-add thanks section to readme
-specially for DS and the rest of the, uumh, stolen? borrowed, code. ahem.
-iesdp, weidu, NI, davidW for scs, the usual: add them as well.

Firewine:
-finish scripts for the Ghosts (see gembowinfo.txt)
-something else i forgot now
-balance fight for a ~5th level party

Gembow:
-finish patches and specific effects for each of them
-better to ship finished product than at-install gen? test, need working version
-test installation & in-game.

(one of each test, succesful on a single platform should get us to beta status)
Test:
-installation: in vbg1, bgt, bg:ee, eet
-spawn: in vbg1, bgt, modded bgt, bg:ee, eet
-firewine battle: in vbg1, bgt, bg:ee

-gembow: in vbg1, bgt, bg:ee, tutu
-scripts: in vbg1, bgt, bg:ee
-dialog: in vbg1, bg:ee
-banter: in vbg1, bg:ee, bgt, tutu
-crashes: in vbg1, eet, tutu
