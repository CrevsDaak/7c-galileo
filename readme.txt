	- Banters between Galileo and your PC.
	- Galileo interjections.
	- Song of Wyvernspur spell.
	- Galileo portrait.
Installing this mod will change:
	- Gandolar Luckyfoot's dialogue.
	- Some other stuff, just you wait, you've got something coming, pal.

-----------------------
II. Introduction
-----------------------

Galileo is an energetic, melodramatic halfling Jester. He is imaginative,
crafting his own bizarre songs to sow disc(h)ord amongst his enemies.
He is a jealous sort and will accordingly vie for the attention of those
he seeks to please, but is always reliable as well. A follower of Finder
Wyvernspur, Galileo holds his own share of religious convictions, too.
Being a young, intrepid halfling, he seeks to find adventure, inspiration,
and true love.

Galileo can be found in the halfling village of Gullykin, where he enjoys
the company of his new friends, but longs for something more exciting than
an old tobacco pipe.

VII. Lines
-----------------------

I am practicing my fake British accent before I finally record these.

Leader: What? The Jester in the front? Have you gone mad?
Battle Cry 1: Prepare to die, obviously!
Battle Cry 2: You will find honor in death!
Battle Cry 3: Yes, blood of the innocents! Sorry, got carried away.
Bored: Oi, don't we have anything better to do?
Tired: This is making me very tired. You won't like me when I'm tired.
Morale Failure: Time to bugger off!
Badly Wounded: I must admit, I'm bleeding quite a bit.
Selected 1: Aye?
Selected 2: You need me?
Selected 3: How can I help you?
Action 1: Well okay then, boss!
Action 2: I'll see what I can do.
Action 3: An excellent plan, good sir.
Rare 1: Can I just sing instead? No? Fine.
Rare 2: But I don't want any of that. I'd rather just sing.
Rare 3: I'm going on an adventure!
Rare 4: Does this seem like a good idea to you? Yes other Galileo, yes it does.
Day: I'm walkin' on sunshine! Whoa-oh!
Night: The night is young, and you're so beautiful.
Forest: If you listen closely, the wind in the trees play their own tune, don't you see?
Dungeon: There's nothing quite like a crawl in a dungeon, but I can't wait to get out.
City: These human settlements never cease to amaze me. So ambitious and filled with wonder.
Alora Death: No! Not Alora...
Coran Death: A merrier fool I've never known.
Garrick Death: Goodnight, sweet bard.
Montaron Death: A stranger halfling I've never met, but I already miss him.
Quayle Death: And here I thought he was too smart to die.
Tiax Death: Mad as a hatter, dead and it does not matter.
Critical Miss: D'oh!
Critical Hit: Take that, you bastard!
Pick Pocket: I need this more than you do. Honest.

VIII. Credits
-----------------------

Writing, voice acting: Riordan Zentler, AKA Quartz
Programming, implementation: Nicol√°s Clotta, AKA CrevsDaak
Portrait: Isandir

Quartz: I want to issue a huge thanks to Crevs for helping me with this
project. At a certain point, I realized that I very much wanted to make
a NPC mod, for Baldur's Gate will always be one of my favorite games,
and I enjoy creative writing and voice acting. It wouldn't have been possible
without his programming help, as coding intimidates me and I would've lost
heart without his implementation of my hours of work.

	Furthermore, I would love to thank my Baldur's Gate Forum fellow Isandir
for crafting the lovely portrait and not even asking for anything in return.
What a guy. He stuck as close to the original art style as he could, which is not
only impressive, but it also satiates my terrible obsessive-compulsive habits!

	But the project is still young, and it is likely that other people will
contribute in some way or the other. And so, this section is incomplete,
which is a beautiful thing.
