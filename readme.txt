II. Introduction
-----------------------

Galileo is an energetic, melodramatic halfling Jester. He is imaginative, crafting his own bizarre songs to sow disc(h)ord amongst his enemies. He is a jealous sort and will accordingly vie for the attention of those he seeks to please, but is always reliable as well. A follower of Finder Wyvernspur, Galileo holds his own share of religious convictions, too. Being a young, intrepid halfling, he seeks to find adventure, inspiration, and true love.

Galileo can be found in the halfling village of Gullykin, where he enjoys the company of his new friends, but longs for something more exciting than an old tobacco pipe.

Biography:
When asked about his past, GALILEO appears overjoyed, as if no question could make him happier. He informs you that he was raised in Secomber, to the Northeast of the Sword Coast. He became acquainted with music experiencing open performances at an inn called The Seven-Stringed Harp, and apparently took it into his own hands to learn to play music himself. His muse is a confusing mixture of genius and madness, and GALILEO claims that it is none other than demipower Finder Wyvernspur who inspires him. However a halfling such as himself was introduced to such a deity is anyone's guess.

Special Ability:
Song of Wyvernspur, once per day.
Heals party members 1d8+1/level hit points of all party members within a 10 meter radius of Galileo.
At level 10, it also grants party members immunity to fear for 1 round/level of caster, and cures fear.

VI. Tips
-----------------------

The following tips are spoiler free in terms of dialogue and the like.

Galileo uses Axes and Darts so you can sword while you board, and board while you sword. Buckley's Buckler is a nice choice.
Have that little halfling fool hurl Darts of Stunning before meleeing people in the face with his axe. Ow.
It makes for very good fun times to be invisible and sing a Jester song.

VIII. Credits
-----------------------

Creative direction, writing, voice acting: Riordan Zentler, AKA Quartz
Programming, implementation: Nicol√°s Clotta, AKA CrevsDaak
Portrait: Isandir
Item sketches: Diedrich Zentler, AKA Zphal

Quartz: I want to issue a huge thanks to Crevs for helping me with this project. At a certain point, I realized that I very much wanted to make a NPC mod, for Baldur's Gate will always be one of my favorite games, and I enjoy creative writing and voice acting. It wouldn't have been possible without his programming help, as coding intimidates me and I would've lost heart without his implementation of my hours of work.
	Furthermore, I would love to thank my Baldur's Gate Forum fellow Isandir for crafting the lovely portrait and not even asking for anything in return. What a guy. He stuck as close to the original art style as he could, which is not only impressive, but it also satiates my terrible obsessive-compulsive habits!
	But the project is still young, and it is likely that other people will contribute in some way or the other. And so, this section is incomplete, which is a beautiful thing.
