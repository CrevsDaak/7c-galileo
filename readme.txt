Biography:
When asked about his past, GALILEO appears overjoyed, as if no question could make him happier. He informs you that he was raised in Secomber, to the Northeast of the Sword Coast. He became acquainted with music experiencing open performances at an inn called The Seven-Stringed Harp, and apparently took it into his own hands to learn to play music himself. His muse is a confusing mixture of genius and madness, and GALILEO claims that it is none other than demipower Finder Wyvernspur who inspires him. However a halfling such as himself was introduced to such a deity is anyone's guess.

Special Ability:
Song of Wyvernspur, once per day.
Heals party members 1d8+1/level hit points of all party members within a 10 meter radius of Galileo.
At level 10, it also grants party members immunity to fear for 1 round/level of caster, and cures fear.
At level 20, it also grants party members immunity to confusion/charm for 1 round/level of caster, and cures confusion/charm.

VI. Tips
-----------------------

The following tips are MOSTLY spoiler free in terms of dialogue and the like.

Galileo uses Axes and Darts so you can sword while you board, and board while you sword. Buckley's Buckler is a nice choice.
Have that little halfling fool hurl Darts of Stunning before meleeing people in the face with his axe. Ow.
It makes for very good fun times to be invisible and sing a Jester song.
Galileo and Alora exchange a lot of banters together. Bien, me gusta.

VIII. Credits

Creative direction, writing, voice acting: Riordan Zentler, AKA Quartz
Programming, implementation, miscellaneous (mis)guidance: Nicolás Clotta, AKA CrevsDaak
Portrait: Isandir
Item sketches: Diedrich Zentler, AKA Zphal
Second Opinion: Johnathan Konandreas, AKA booinyoureyes
EET testing, Official Unofficial EET Beta Tester Volunteer™: WhiteAgnus

Quartz:
I want to issue a huge thanks to Crevs for helping me with this project. At a certain point, I realized that I very much wanted to make a NPC mod, as Baldur's Gate will always be one of my favorite games, and I enjoy creative writing and voice acting. It wouldn't have been possible without his programming help, as coding intimidates me and I would've lost heart without his implementation of my work. Paint is not good for much without a canvas, and Crevs built the canvas.
I also must thank Isandir for crafting a marvellous portrait and turning me down when I offered a modest commission fee. What a guy. I couldn't be more happy with the Galileo portrait.
A big thank you to booinyoureyes for being my second opinion on EVERY Galileo-NPC banter. In doing this project, it was very important to me to not derail the existing NPCs in any way; no out of character moments. He helped me greatly by being a second opinion in these things, and much tweaking was done.
