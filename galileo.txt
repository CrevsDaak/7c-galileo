======== USE OF VARIABLES ========

- GLOBAL 7C#DoneFirewineRuins (BG1):
  This variable is set to 1 when the Firewine
  quest is accomplished. Both Gandolar and Galileo
  will set it when variable SPRITE_IS_DEADDICK is set
  to 1.

  Checked by Galileo for his first time joining dialog
  and for a quest-specific banter about Jenkal and reporting
  back to Gandolar.

- GLOBAL 7C#GalileoJustRaisedBack (BG1):
  This variable is set to 1 (by 7c#gal01.bcs) after
  Galileo is raised for the first time (the variable is actually
  set when he dies, so when he is reaised back you he
  automatically dialogs the PC), and to 2 by 7c#gal1j.dlg.

  Checked by 7c#gal1j.dlg and 7c#gal01.bcs.

- GLOBAL 7C#GalileoJaheiraBanter (BG1):
  Is set to 1 by 7c#gal01.bcs, checked in 7c#gal1j.dlg
  to trigger the banter. It is set to 2 by 7c#gal1.dlg after the
  banter happens.

- GLOBAL 7C#GhostsSpawned (BG1):
  It is set to 1 after the Halfling Ghosts (and associated
  invisible creatuers) are spawned in the Firewine Ruins
  [AR5201]. Only checked by that BAF block itself.

- LOCALS 7C#GalileoHappiness (BG1):
  This variable's default value is 10. It measures Galileo's
  Happiness while not in the party.

  Currently used for his BG1 first time joining dialog and his
  replies if he does not join the first time.
  Set to 10 by ar4000, checked only by dialog 7c#gal1p.



- LOCALS 7C#GalileoInParty (BG1):
  This variable is set to 0 if Galileo never joined the party, to
  1 if he joined and was kicked but did not join again, to 2 if he's
  currently in the party, to 4 if he is turned hostile and 5 if he is
  hostile and already said his I-turned-hostile line via DisplayStringHead().

  It is checked by the scripts 7c#gal01 and 7c#gal00 and dialogs 7c#gal1j
  and 7c#gal1p only.



- LOCALS 7C#GalileoMelicampComment (BG1):
  Used by script 7c#gal01 and dialog 7c#gal1j.
  Set to 1 when timer starts, to 2 when talk is made, and 3 after that.
  0 otherwise (if the player picked up Melicamp without Galileo).




- LOCALS 7C#GalileoDeadHalflingComment (BG1):
  Used by script 7c#gal01 and dialog 7c#gal1j.
  set to 1 when talk starts, 2 after talking. 0 otherwise.



======== USE OF TIMERS ========

  Used for the joke about Melicamp. Only used once and only
  by script 7c#gal01.


- LOCALS 7C#SpellCast (BG1):
  Used only by script 7c#gal00 to leave one round between each spell
  in case Galileo has to defend himself it attacked by the player.
