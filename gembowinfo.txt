PLOT
=========================

<Coming within view of Wenwan>
Wenwan: Hello then. How very refreshing to see the face of someone other than a kobold. My apologies for pointing an arrow at your face, I'm afraid it's become second nature as of late. I am Wenwan, and these are my comrades-in-arms. To what do I owe the honor?
1. Greetings. Gullykin, the village above, is a troubled town as of late, and I am seeking out the source.
	Wenwan: Then you need look no further. There is an ogre mage who stalks these halls, commanding kobolds to rob the village in waves. Dispose of him, and the crisis will quickly subside.
	1. You lot look plenty powerful yourself. What stops you?
		Wenwan: That human mage, Lendarn, has cast a spell that bars our entrance beyond a certain distance. While the four of us have maintained a far greater semblance of our former selves compared to many undead, we still carry such weaknesses. I've no idea what manner of man would associate himself with such scum, but that is irrelevant.
		1. Very well then. Could you point the way?
			Wenwan: Certainly. The passage to the Northeast will get you there. Do be cautious. Return to us when the deed is done, it will be a relief to hear of your success. <END DIALOGUE>
		<option available if OGREQUEST=1>
		2. That's all very well and interesting, but that ogre mage has a price on your head.
			Wenwan: Oh really? Shall I give you the benefit of the doubt in assuming that you were coerced into hunting us, or are you just as much a cur as that Lendarn tool?
			1. We were given little option, but truth be known, I rather like the option. Your bow catches the light quite nicely, I can only assume it's extremely valuable.
				Wenwan: You fool. We've been guarding these halls for centuries, and so it shall remain. <END DIALOGUE, SET HALFLING GHOSTS HOSTILE>
			2. It's true, we bargained for our lives. Could you help us turn the tide somehow?
				Wenwan: Since you asked, we are in possession of an Arrow of Slaying. This particular one just so happens to be attuned to ogre mages. If it helps you, we shall give it to you.
				1. You have been more than reasonable. Thank you.
					Wenwan: Indeed. One last piece of advice?
					Wenwan: Don't miss. <END DIALOGUE, PLACE ONE ARROW OF SLAYING IN SPEAKER'S INVENTORY>
	2. Very well then. Could you point the way?
		Wenwan: Certainly. The passage to the Northeast will get you there. Do be cautious. Return to us when the deed is done, it will be a relief to hear of your success. <END DIALOGUE>

2. I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. Just crawling through a dungeon, really.
	Wenwan: Is that so? Well, you seem the adventurous sort. How fond are you of ogre mages?
	<KIVAN INTERJECT> Kivan: I thought I smelt one of those beasts when we crawled in here.
	1. Not very fond. Why do you ask?
		Wenwan: An ogre mage has recently fortified itself in these ruins, and has made itself quite a pest. With his raids of Gullykin, I'm sure he's amassed a fair share of treasure. I may offer you something of my own as well if you disposed of him.
		1. Deal. Could you point the way?
			Wenwan: Certainly. The passage to the Northeast will get you there. Do be cautious. Return to us when the deed is done, it will be a relief to hear of your success. <END DIALOGUE>
		2. Not really feeling the need to hunt down an ogre, but thanks for the information.
			Wenwan: Very well then. <END DIALOGUE>
	2. I suppose there are worse critters out there.
		Wenwan: Yes well, I don't believe we're holding a contest. The point is, an ogre mage has recently fortified itself in these ruins, and has made itself quite a pest. With his raids of Gullykin, I'm sure he's amassed a fair share of treasure. I may offer you something of my own as well if you disposed of him.
		1. Deal. Could you point the way?
			Wenwan: Certainly. The passage to the Northeast will get you there. Do be cautious. Return to us when the deed is done, it will be a relief to hear of your success. <END DIALOGUE>
		2. Not really feeling the need to hunt down an ogre, but thanks for the information.
			Wenwan: Very well then. <END DIALOGUE>

<option available if OGREQUEST=1>
3. How about I point an arrow at your face instead?
	Wenwan: Well now, I've already apologized. What could possibly warrant such hostility?
	1. A certain ogre mage has a price on your head, and I'd like to collect it.
		Wenwan: Ahh, consorting with ogre mages, are we? Then you are just as low as that tool, Lendarn. We've been guarding these halls for centuries, and so it shall remain. <END DIALOGUE, SET HALFLING GHOSTS HOSTILE>
	2. A certain ogre mage has a price on your head. But perhaps you fetch a more fair price for his? I notice you've your fair share of magical treasure.
		Wenwan: If you think I'm about to hand over one of the few remaining gem bows in Faerun to a traitorous cur as yourself, you're mistaken. Draw steel. <END DIALOGUE, SET HALFLING GHOSTS HOSTILE>

<note for a future dialogue. don't do anything with this shit>
I bestow this bow unto you, that it may be put to better use than it is locked away in a dusty old tomb such as this. You have proven yourself worthy.

DESCRIPTIONS
=========================


Uncharged Gem Bow

Created long ago by a prestigious halfling bowyer and the Archmage Bendalyre, gem bows were developed to help halfling societies combat their enemies. Over the years, the gem bows have disappeared from halfling realms. They are now lost and all but forgotten by the race that created them. All are of excellent craftsmanship, and have the ability to gain additional powers. On the face of each bow is an indentation above the handgrip. If certain gemstones are set into this notch, the bow is then capable of bestowing one of numerous special powers on any arrow fired. Its abilities do not stack with magically imbued arrows.
