DESCRIPTIONS

Uncharged Gem Bow

Created long ago by a prestigious halfling bowyer and the Archmage Bendalyre, gem bows were developed to help halfling societies combat their enemies. Over the years, the gem bows have disappeared from halfling realms. They are now lost and all but forgotten by the race that created them. All are of excellent craftsmanship, and have the ability to gain additional powers. On the face of each bow is an indentation above the handgrip. If certain gemstones are set into this notch, the bow is then capable of bestowing one of numerous special powers on any arrow fired.
